A discord bot

A little personal project of mine to get more proficient in javascript. This bot is made for my personal server so a lot of the implementations and functions will be very specific!

This bot is made using the discord.js node module.

To run this bot on your own server:
- Install node.js 7.6.0 or newer
- Clone this repository somewhere on your PC.
- Fill in src/config.json with your values
- run the command 'nodejs alfred.js'


Todo:

- Discord.fm
  - Ability to change channel
  - Stop command
- RSS feeds
  - A way to automatically post game news, server status changes etc to the server.
